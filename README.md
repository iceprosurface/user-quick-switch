Quickly Switch Login Accounts
During development, frequently switching between different user accounts can become a cumbersome task. To enhance development efficiency, we have specially developed a Chrome extension that allows you to easily switch login accounts through the context menu.

Key Features:

Convenient Switching: Quickly switch between different login accounts via the context menu without repeatedly entering usernames and passwords.
Multi-Account Management: Supports storage and management of multiple accounts, making it easy to switch in different testing environments.
Auto Login: Automatically completes login after switching accounts, saving time and increasing efficiency.
How to Use:

After installing the extension, right-click on a blank area of the webpage.
In the context menu that appears, select "Switch Identity."
Choose the desired account from the list, and you will be automatically logged in.
